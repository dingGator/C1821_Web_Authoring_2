     <h2><br>How Devils Millhopper Got Its Name<br></h2>
     <p class="nameStory">The park gets its name from its funnel-like shape.  In the 1800's, farmers grind grain in grist mills.<br></p>
     <p>  The grain is fed into the grinder thru a funnel shaped container, or hopper.  Due to fossilized bones and teeth found at the bottom of the sinkhole, this is said to be the millhopper that fed bodies to the devil.  Thus the Devil's Millhopper.<br></p>

<h2><br>Geological Story of Devils Millhopper<br></h2>
<p class="geoStory">Devils Millhopper is a sinkhole that is 117 feet deep and 500 feet across.  It is formed when surface soils collapse into large cavities that underlying limestone bedrock has accumulated thru the years.<br></p><p>  The rainwater became slightly acidic due to the carbon dioxide in the air.  As it passes thru dead plants material, it became more acidic.  Slowly the acidic rain dissolved the limestone forming caverns. <br><</p><p> When the ceiling of the cavern can no longer be supported, the ceiling collapse and the sinkhole is formed.  That is how Devils Millhopper is formed.</p>

<h2><br>The Legend of the Devils Millhopper<br></h2>
        <p class="legends">


Once upon a time, a beautiful Indian Princess lived in a village near the present day Devils Millhopper sink hole.  The Devil wanted to marry the Indian princess, but she did not want to marry the Devil.<br>
</p>
<p> The Devil kidnaps the princess and ran.  All the Indian braves of her village were deeply saddened and began chasing the Devil and the princess.  As the braves came closer to the Devil, the Devil created a huge sinkhole for the braves to fall into, thus the Devils Millhopper.<br></p><p>  When the braves tried to climb out of the sinkhole to save the princess, the Devil turned them to stone.  Thus the weeping of water from the stones along the slopes of Devilâ€™s Millhopper are the tears of the Indian braves shed for the Indian princess.<br><br>
